      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how this application (“we”, “our”, “the application”) collects, uses, and protects personal information when users log in through Facebook Login.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>When you log in using Facebook Login and grant permission, we may access the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public profile information (such as name and profile picture)</li>
        <li>Email address (if you consent to share it)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No additional Facebook data will be collected without your explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User authentication and account identification</li>
        <li>Providing account-related services, such as login and user session handling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your information with third parties unless required by law or with your explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>3. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
      <p>We do not retain Facebook user data longer than necessary to provide app functionality. If data retention is required, we will clearly inform users about the scope and duration.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. However, no method of online transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may use third-party services (such as hosting, analytics, or authentication systems). These providers may process data according to their own privacy policies. We choose partners that align with industry privacy standards.</p>
